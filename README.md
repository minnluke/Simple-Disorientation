# Simple-Disorientation
The simple disorientation plugin is a Rhino-based Python Plugin that can be used to generate intricate sculptural shapes, through a simple definition for any level of users. It starts with a simple geometry of a cube. The first iteration starts with an edge condition that is either an element, object or shape. Following iterations are defined by data loops, in which the iterations are repeated in a similar way. Different structures are seen to arise from subtle variations of the function definition. My focus was to build atypical architectural components that can be implemented in a virtual space.
